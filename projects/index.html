          <p>We&rsquo;re looking for speakers for our meetup!</p>

          <a class="button" href="../submit-talk/">Submit a talk</a>

          <h2>When/where is it?</h2>
          <p>Every last Tuesday of the month at Cup and Bar! Our upcoming dates are May 31st, June 28th & July 26th.</p>

          <h2>What should I talk about?</h2>
          <p>We don’t have a strict formula, but this is the balance we try to strike every month:</p>

          <h3>2&times; Creative Talks:</h3>
          <p>Creative applications of programming. Such as: generating lego murals out of static images, and building an in-browser RPG, generative art, etc.</p>

          <h3>1&times; Passion Talk:</h3>
          <p>Something you’re excited about outside of work. This can literally be anything! Kittens, mental health, how much you love burritos.</p>

          <h3>1&times; Technical Talk:</h3>
          <p>A deep dive on a technical topic!</p>

          <h2>Do I need to be an expert to talk?</h2>
          <p>Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to participate. We especially encourage people of underrepresented groups to apply!</p>

          <h2>How long should my talk be?</h2>
          <p>Ten minutes. There won&rsquo;t be any formal Q&amp;A.</p>

          <h2>What should be in my talk submission?</h2>
          <p>Just a few sentences describing what you want to talk about would be great.</p>
