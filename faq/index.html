          <h2>What is Science Hack Day?</h2>
          <p>Science Hack Day is an international event where anyone excited about making weird, 
            silly or serious things with science comes together in the same physical space to 
            see what they can prototype within 24 consecutive hours. Designers, developers, 
            scientists and anyone who is excited about making things with science are 
            welcome to attend. No experience in science or hacking is necessary -  
            just an insatiable curiosity. Read more about it <a href="http://sciencehackday.org/about/">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>Who is this event for?</h2>
          <p>This event is for anyone who gets excited about science and hacking, 
            including designers, students, engineers, programmers, scientists, artists, 
            and science-enthusiasts! </p>

          <h2>Does that include me?</h2>
          <p>Short answer is: yes!</p>

          <h4>I don't know enough science.</h4>
          <p>That's ok! This event is for anyone who appreciates science and wants to spend 
            a weekend having fun with others.</p>

          <h4>I don't consider myself a hacker!</h4>
          <p>Hacker is someone who thinks of a quick solution to a problem - maybe not the 
            most elegant solution, but often the cleverest.</p>

          <h4>I don't know anyone going.</h4>
          <p>We'll help you find projects and teams. We're also hosting meet and greet 
            events where you can connect with other hackers.</p>

          <h4>I can't think of any project for the event.</h4>
          <p>That's ok! We'll host meetups before Science Hack Day and help you get inspired 
            during the event.</p>

          <h4>I don't think I have the right skills.</h4>
          <p>It's ok, everyone says that! We'll help you find projects where your expertise 
            and input will be super valuable.</p>

          <h2>Do you have examples of projects?</h2>
          <p>You can read about projects from previous Science Hack Days and other hack 
            events on <a href="../projects/">the Projects page</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>What tools will be available?</h2>
          <p>In addition to ample workspace to do projects and wi-fi, basic 
            electronic prototyping equipment will be available (soldering irons, Arduinos, etc). 
            We will also have multiple 3D printers on hand. For more demanding projects 
            we have access to nearby makerspaces and fabrication labs and can help facilitate 
            access to specific tools for your prototype.
          </p>

          <h2>Is there an age limit for the sleepover?</h2>
          <p>Yes, the optional sleepover is for those 18 or older.</p>

          <h2>Can children attend too?</h2>
          <p>Yes, this is a family-friendly event, but children must be accompanied by 
            at least one adult.</p>

          <h2>Is there a Code of Conduct?</h2>
          <p>Yes! Science Hack Day PDX is an inclusive event based on treating all individuals 
            respectfully. Everyone is required to read and follow the 
            <a href="https://github.com/ScienceHackDayPDX/Science-Hack-Day-PDX-2017/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">
