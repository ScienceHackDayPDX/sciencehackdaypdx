          <h2>What is Science Hack Day?</h2>
          <p>Science Hack Day is a two-day-all-night event where anyone excited about making weird, silly or serious things with science comes together in the same physical space to see what they can prototype within 24 consecutive hours. Designers, developers, scientists and anyone who is excited about making things with science are welcome to attend â€“ no experience in science or hacking is necessary, just an insatiable curiosity. Read more about it <a href="http://sciencehackday.org/about/">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>Who is this event for?</h2>
          <p>This event is for anyone who gets excited about science and hacking, including designers, students, engineers, programmers, scientists, artists, and science-enthusiasts! </p>

          <h2>Does that include me?</h2>
          <p>Short answer is: yes!</p>

          <h4>I don't know enough science.</h4>
          <p>That's ok! This event is for anyone who appreciates science and wants to spend a weekend having fun with others.</p>

          <h4>I don't consider myself a hacker!</h4>
          <p>Hacker is someone who thinks of a quick solution to a problem - maybe not the most elegant solution, but often the cleverest.</p>

          <h4>I don't know anyone going.</h4>
          <p>We'll help you find projects and teams. We're also hosting meet and greet meetups where you can connect with other hackers.</p>

          <h4>I can't think of any project for the event.</h4>
          <p>That's ok! We'll host meetups before Science Hack Day, and help you get inspired during the event.</p>

          <h4>I don't think I have the right skills.</h4>
          <p>It's ok, everyone says that! We'll help you find projects where your expertise and input will be super valuable.</p>

          <h2>Do you have examples of projects?</h2>
          <p>You can read about projects from previous Science Hack Days and other hack events from <a href="../projects/">the Project page</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>Is there an age limit for the sleepover?</h2>
          <p>Yes, the optional sleepover is for those older than 18.</p>

          <h2>Can children attend too?</h2>
          <p>Yes, this is a family-friendly event, though, at least one adult must be present in each team.</p>
          <h2>I want to attend! What do I do now?</h2>
          <p>Please register <a href="https://ti.to/maxogden/science-hack-day-pdx">here</a>. If you want to, introduce yourself on <a href="https://sciencepdxslackin.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a>. There will be meetups before the event, so keep an eye out!
